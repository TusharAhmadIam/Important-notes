Important notes for UE 5
-----------
Bulueprint
-----------
	Flow controll
	-------------
	Branch (node)				-> If statement
	Sequench (node)				-> One after one
	Flip Flop (node)			-> Toggler between A - B
	Gate (node)
	interp to
	vector length xy
	Lerp					-> Returns percentage value
	Lerp(vector)
	--------------
	Character
	--------------
	Add controler Pitch input		-> Look up down	(Note: Bp_PlayerCharacter -> camera -> camera options -> use pawn control rotation - enable)
	Add controler Yaw input			-> Look Left right
	Add movement input			-> Moves a character
	Get control rotation			-> Gets rotation of actor
	Get forward vector			-> Gets axis forward 
	Get right vector			-> Gets axis righ
	get turn				-> Gives turn value
	Event BeginPlay				-> This event occurs when game start
	Event ActorBeginOverlap			-> This event occurs when actor overlap something
	Event Trick				-> This event occurs in every fps such as (60 fps)
	Get socket location
	Get socket Rotation
	Get actor location
	Get player controller
	-------------
	Pause game
	-------------
	Is game paused				-> Checks game paused or not
	Set game paused				-> Pauses games
	--------------
	Intput 
	--------------
	Enable input				-> Enables input in other blueprint classes
	Action mapping				-> Occurs one time or one unit
	Axis mapping				-> Occurs over & over again
	--------------
	Material
	--------------
	Tips					-> Always use texture in material (insteat of node constant).Texture will speed up your game fps.
	emmesive color				-> It is like lighting to the object
	specular				-> It is like leather
	Texture Coordinate			-> In uvs
	Component Mask				-> Gives colours separately
	Panner					-> Animate texture/material
	Time
	Material Instance
	Sine					-> Animates -1 to 1
	Saturate				-> Clamps the value between 0 and 1
	Lerp
	Sine_Remapped (function)		-> Remaps the output of sine wave
	Desaturation				-> Modify saturation
	Power					-> Modify contrast
	Switch					->
	--------------
	Niagra System
	--------------
	Emitter state 
	Inatialize particle
	Particle state
	Add a renderer
	Spawn rate
	Add velocity
	Shape location
	Scale sprite size
	Scale color
	Vector noise force
	Solve forces and velocity	
	--------------
	Game Mode
	--------------
	Tips					-> Change Default Game mode from project settings - maps and modes
						-> Overwrite Game Mode from world settings
	Hud (class)				-> Players Ammo, Health etc
	Default Pawn class			-> Default player	
	---------------
	Animation
	---------------
	State machine
	state
	get velocity (f)			-> Get speed
	try to get own Pawn			-> Cast to player character here (node)
	ifFalling (f)				-> Player is on ground or not (boolean)
	New save cached pose			-> 
	Time remaining				-> Checks animation finish time
	Interp to				-> Like timeline / Animates some value 
	Animation montage
	Layered blend per bone			-> It will separate body when animation
	Animation aim offset
	--------------
	Direction
	--------------
	get actor rotation			-> where is actor looking
	get control rotation
	get socket rotation
	calculate direction
	delta (rotator)				> it calculates the change between two rotation 
	--------------
	Collapsing
	--------------
	Tips					-> Always try to avoid "collapse to function" - It will slow down your game a little - Try to use collapse to node and macroes
	--------------------
	Timer
	--------------------
	Set timer by event
	Set timer by function
	--------------------
	Math
	--------------------
	Clamp					-> Returns a value between two given numbers
	--------------------
	Trace
	--------------------
	Line trace by channel
	--------------------
	Project world to screen			-> Gives Screen Position
	Get viewport size
	---------------------
	Distance
	---------------------
	Distance 2d
	Distance 3d
	--------------------
	Audio
	--------------------
	Play sound at location
	Set boolean parameter
	Set integer parameter
	Set float parameter
	Execute trigger parameter
