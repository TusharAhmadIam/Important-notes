Important notes for UE 5

Bulueprint
-----------
	Flow controll
	-------------
	Branch (node)				-> If statement
	Sequench (node)				-> One after one
	Flip Flop (node)			-> Toggler between A - B
	Gate (node)
	--------------
	Functions
	--------------
	Lerp						-> Returns percentage value
	Lerp(vector)
	--------------
	Character
	--------------
	Add controler Pitch input	-> Look up down	(Note: Bp_PlayerCharacter -> camera -> camera options -> use pawn control rotation - enable)
	Add controler Yaw input		-> Look Left right
	Add movement input			-> Moves a character
	Get control rotation		-> Gets rotation of actor
	Get forward vector			-> Gets axis forward 
	Get right vector			-> Gets axis righ
	get turn					-> Gives turn value
	-------------
	Pause game
	-------------
	Is game paused				-> Checks game paused or not
	Set game paused				-> Pauses games
	--------------
	Intput 
	--------------
	Enable input				-> Enables input in other blueprint classes
	Action mapping				-> Occurs one time or one unit
	Axis mapping				-> Occurs over & over again
	--------------
	Material
	--------------
	Tips						-> Always use texture in material (insteat of node constant).Texture will speed up your game fps.
	emmesive color				-> It is like lighting to the object
	specular					-> It is like leather
	--------------
	Game Mode
	--------------
	Tips						-> Change Default Game mode from project settings - maps and modes
								-> Overwrite Game Mode from world settings
	Hud (class)					-> Players Ammo, Health etc
	Default Pawn class			-> Default player	
	---------------
	Bp_character
	---------------
	Event BeginPlay				-> This event occurs when game start
	Event ActorBeginOverlap		-> This event occurs when actor overlap something
	Event Trick					-> This event occurs in every fps such as (60 fps)
	---------------
	Animation
	---------------
	State machine
	state
	get velocity (f)			-> Get speed
	try to get own Pawn			-> Cast to player character here (node)
	ifFalling (f)				-> Player is on ground or not (boolean)
	New save cached pose		-> 
	--------------
	Direction
	--------------
	get actor rotation			-> where is actor looking
	get control rotation
	calculate direction
	delta (rotator)				> it calculates the change between two rotation 
	--------------
	Collapsing
	--------------
	Tips						-> Always try to avoid "collapse to function" - It will slow down your game a little - Try to use collapse to node and macroes
	--------------------
	Animation montage
	--------------------
	Layered blend per bone		-> It will separate body when animation
	--------------------
	Animation aim offset
	--------------------
